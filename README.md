# Acme Rockets

Welcome to the **Acme Rockets** project! This project was created to practice and showcase the use of **TailwindCSS** along with basic **HTML** and a bit of **JavaScript**. Itâ€™s a simple web-based project focused on building responsive and visually appealing UI components.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- **TailwindCSS**: For the styling and layout. This project utilizes utility-first CSS to create a highly customizable, responsive design.

## Project Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes, making the site accessible on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
